### Model 1:  Serve as a Lab Helper or Tech Staff

## Site Introduction
*Where is the site located?*  

Instructional & Information Technology Services (IITS) at Haverford College is located at Stokes Hall on the second level.
IITS provides support for a large variety of technology and instruction-related issues, including
IT infrastructure and networking (Core Systems), Instructional Technology, the College's Enterprise Systems
and client services. ProDesk is the central point of service for all IITS activities.  ProDesk has a single physical
desk at the entrance to IITS as well as a small workshop for repairs and storage.     

*Who runs it?*  
Andrew Bartolomeo is the primary Support Representative.  He is responsible for day to day operations at ProDesk and delegates
all incoming requests to various sections of IITS.  In a recent assessment of technology use on campus, recent changes at ProDesk,
notably very fast response times have been widely celebrated by students and faculty.  

There are student employees at ProDesk who answer phones, perform off-site repairs and other tasks as needed. 
Swan Vacula is the ProDesk Coordinator and Infrastructure Liaison.  Swan manages all ProDesk employees as well as budgeting,
vendor relations and irregular problems.   

*Who does it serve?*  
IITS and ProDesk serve the technology needs of all members of the Haverford community, including faculty, staff, students, alumni and campus guests. 
IITS maintains all on-site infrastructure.  

ProDesk handles service and support for all faculty and staff computers.  This includes
personal and college machines.  I helped a staff member identify a tablet that would meet their needs.  I also recommended
Microcenter to a contingent faculty member looking to replace his current machine.  As term-faculty, he is not provided a college machine.
ProDesk handles all requests relating to our five public computing labs and the library's "information hub."  
Every single classroom at Haverford is equipped with a Mac with project or large display. 

Instructional Technology maintains a Center with 28 stations with iMacs, DVD players, scanners and other media related devices, including
digital video and audio recording devices.  One of my sessions involved a Japanese film class where the students are creating their own
films using the style of a famous Japanese director.  In the session, we created location and prop lists for their screenplays. 


*How did you get involved?*
While I've had some interaction with our Linux Administrator, I did not know anyone in IITS.  I wrote to 
the head of Instructional Technology, who referred me to Swan with the idea of my working at ProDesk.  In short,
these are my colleagues and they were interested in getting to know a new community member from the Library. 

## Technology Inventory
*What technology (computers, peripherals, switches, hubs and routers) is used at the site?*  
There are two Lenovo workstations at the desk.  However, both Andrew and the students typically use
their personal notebooks.  A wide variety of devices are brought to the desk for repair.  The workshop is full
of machines and parts (I can try for a larger manifest later).  There is also a storage closet with loaner computers and access points.  
In the basement there is a server room and data center.  There is a dark fibre running to nearby Bryn Mawr College.   


## User Services
*Who are the users that you are serving?* 
ProDesk works with College staff, faculty, students and campus guests.  They also assist Swarthmore and Bryn Mawr students
when they are on campus for classes or events.  

*What are their needs?* 
The key services that users need are internet connectivity on and off campus, email, Moodle, audio-visual presentations, and so on.


*How did they seek help?*
The primary mode of interaction with ProDesk is the email prodesk@haverford.edu.  Phone and walk-in is also
available, but used much less frequently.  

## Activities Report
*What did you do?*  
User account problems have been the most frequent issue that I've seen.  People forget or change their credentials.  
I have also spoken with several people who are considering a new computer or device.   

*How did you help users?*  
In my first effort to help, I inspected a library computer that had been reported to ProDesk as broken.
The librarian was confused and a little frustrated that I was only able to confirm what she had already
reported.  To my credit, it wasn't clear from the message if the problem could be repaired with existing parts
or if parts would have to be ordered to fix it.  I spoke with a faculty member who is considering a new computer. 
I also advised a staff member who wants to get a tablet.  In both cases, they were familiar and had preference for 
a specific brand.  The staff member wanted a tablet, but not an iPad. She is happy with Microsoft products, so
the Surface was an easy recommendation.  Similarly, the faculty member likes Dell.  While I would choose otherwise,
I built on his preferences and suggested the best place to buy a Dell with an educational discount.  

The program used to manange ProDesk requests requires credentials that I do not have.  As such, I have mostly 
consulted and observed as Andrew replies to messages and routes tickets to the appropriate office. At the very leat,
this has given me a good idea of the structure of IITS and how tasks are delegated and completed.   


*Did you have any significant accomplishments or learn anything important?* 
I now know the names and faces of the people in IITS.  I understand their positions and responsibilities.  We have a meeting 
tomorrow with the CIO and I feel that I have a good grounding in our current infrastructure and the College's staff to support and maintain 
those systems.    

*Did you end up producing anything that can be used after you leave?*
I now have a much better understanding of the people, organization and technology of IITS.  This will help us in the library
to act as informed partners.  

## Conclusion
Over the semester, I shadowed Andrew at Prodesk for one-hour each week.  I also attended Instructional Technology instruction sessions.
Given that IT and the Library are separate at Haverford, this opportunity has allowed me to become aquainted with the people and services 
provided by IITS and ProDesk.  This will serve the library and Digital Scholarship through a heightened awareness of our partners abilites and 
limitations.  ProDesk gained my presence as an additional resource and point of view in a variety of situations.
